This document will explain you the Part of Speech (POS) tagging and chunking process in NLP using NLTK. , POS and Chunking helps us overcome this weakness: (Bag-of-words fails to capture the structure of the sentences and sometimes give its appropriate meaning.)
What is Part of Speech?
The part of speech explains how a word is used in a sentence. There are eight main parts of speech - nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions and interjections.
Most POS are divided into sub-classes. POS Tagging simply means labeling words with their appropriate Part-Of-Speech.

DATA DESCRIPTION
Overview
This is an entity-level sentiment analysis dataset of twitter. Given a message and an entity, the task is to judge the sentiment of the message about the entity. There are four classes in this dataset: Positive, Negative ,Neutral and Irrelevant . We regard messages that are not relevant to the entity (i.e. Irrelevant) as Neutral
Usage
using twitter_training.csv as the training set and twitter_testing.csv as the test set.
Content
DATA CONTAIN 5 COLUMNS AND 74682 ROW
INDEX : INDEX OF A ROW
TWEET ID : ID OF TWEET
ENTITY : TYPES OF VIDEO GAMES BRANDS
SENTIMENT : Positive, Negative ,Neutral and Irrelevant
TWEET CONTENT : A TWEET ITSELF


TOOLS:
Python
Nltk
Matplotlip
Numpy
Networkx
Tensorflow
Holoviews


Baseline Experiments
THE GOAL ïƒ  part of speech (POS) tagging that represented by network graph .
Steps of Experiments :
1) Load data ( Data was splited to Train & Test File )
2) Text pre-processing
Not all the information is useful in making predictions or doing classifications. Reducing the number of words will reduce the input dimension to your model. The way the language is written, it contains lot of information which is grammar specific. Thus when converting to numeric format, word specific characteristics like capitalisation, punctuations, suffixes/prefixes etc. are redundant. Cleaning the data in a way that similar words map to single word and removing the grammar relevant information from text can tremendously reduce the vocabulary. Which methods to apply and which ones to skip depends on the problem at hand.
o Lower casing
o Remove all the special characters - remove all single characters
o Substituting multiple spaces with single space
o Removing prefixed
o remove stop words
o word tokenize - word lemmatization
o POS tag for each word
3) building graph using networkx
o Add nodes for each word and POS tag
o Set node colors based on POS tag
o Draw the network graph
o Show the network graph

RESULTS
pairings between words , tags and the network graph
